# Part 5: Vaccination outcomes

The following plots show what happens when only one population (dogs or people) is vaccinated, with different levels of coverage. The red dots represent the mean number of cases over 100 runs of the simulation, and the boxes show the middle 50 percent of runs. The thick black horizontal line is the median outbreak size for each intervention.

*Why does vaccinating 50 percent of dogs appear to eliminate cases in dogs when vaccinating 50 percent of people only reduces the number of human cases by about 50 percent? What do you think vaccinating 50 percent of dogs would do to the number of human cases, on average? What about the effect of vaccinating 50 percent of people on the number of dog cases?*
