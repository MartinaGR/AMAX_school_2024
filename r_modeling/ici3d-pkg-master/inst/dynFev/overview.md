This exercise uses a simulation model to explore the dynamics and control of an imaginary disease in two populations.  The goals of this tutorial are to

  1. help you develop an intuition for how transmission patterns influence the outcome of interventions,
  2. give you practice in making arguments based on indirect evidence, and
  3. introduce the concept of a *model world*.
  
Some of the model output has been generated previously, and the code for this model and its output is available upon request. You may want to look at this code after you have completed the exercise, but for now you should focus on the model output.
