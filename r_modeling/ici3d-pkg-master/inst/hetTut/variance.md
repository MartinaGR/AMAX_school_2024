# Part 2: Changing Variance & Population

Experimenting: Now we try comparing 30 runs of the same model with the same mean contact rate, but different variance in the contact rate and different populations. 

First, we will focus on just changing the heterogeneity.  When you use a higher or lower variance, what happens to the simulation results?

Now change the population size. Note that the bigger this is the longer the simulation is going to run, so be careful not to choose anything too big (probably not more than 500 or so).

What happens to the randomness in the simulation as you increase population size. How does this change how different levels of heterogeneity (variance in contact rates) affects epidemic dynamics?
