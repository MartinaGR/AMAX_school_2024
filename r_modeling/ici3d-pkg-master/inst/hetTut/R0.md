# Part 3: Heterogeneity & R0

Recall that in a homogeneous model, R0 = beta/gamma. Since we have assumed gamma=1 in this model, we have that R0=beta, if the population is homogeneous.

Explore happens to outbreak dynamics when the *average* R (the number of infectious contacts each infected person makes) is a little less (or a little more) than 1, but individuals are heterogeneous.
