# Stochastic Reed-Frost Model

For the stochastic model, we no longer assume that the average event occurs on each time step.  Now we actually conduct the binomial random draws, so for each time step we get some thing from the range of possible outcomes.

Using the inputs below for population size, *N*, and probability of transmission, *p*, explore the consequences of the rules of this model world.  Think about the following questions:

 - how does the duration of the outbreak scale with changes to *N* and *p*?
 - how does the final size of the outbreak scale with changes to *N* and *p*?
 - what happens with the variability in these outcomes?
 
Feel free to use the colors to compare multiple parameter scenarios at once.
