# Deterministic Reed-Frost Model

For the deterministic model, we assume that the average event occurs on each time step.  What is the average event?  The Reed-Frost model is a series of binomial random draws, so for each time step, the average number of "successes" is the number of trials and probability of success per trial.

**What do "trials" and "probability of success" correspond to in the Reed-Frost model?**

Using the inputs below for population size, *N*, and probability of transmission, *p*, explore the consequences of the rules of this model world.  Think about the following questions:

 - how does the duration of the outbreak scale with changes to *N* and *p*?
 - how does the final size of the outbreak scale with changes to *N* and *p*?
