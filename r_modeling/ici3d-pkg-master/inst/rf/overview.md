In this exercise, we will explore Reed-Frost models using different parameters.  To recall the details of the Reed-Frost model:

 - there is a population of *N* identical individuals, each either a case (*C*), susceptible (*S*), or removed (*R*)
 - time proceeds in fixed steps
 - during each time step, all of the individuals interact
 - when a case interacts with a susceptible individual on a particular time step, there is a probability *p* that on the next time step, that susceptible individual will become a case
 - cases on a particular time step will become recovered on the next time step
